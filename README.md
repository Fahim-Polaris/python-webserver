# python-webserver
A small one-file implementation of a webserver able to send files and process browser requests.

If you want more install Apache, this is just a little tool with minimal support of everything.

## Prerequisities

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage
To use this tool call it with the following command:

```bash
python server.py -p XXXX -dir YYYY
```

or to be more explicit:

```bash
python server.py --port XXXX --directory YYYY
```

The `-p` argument is the port on what the server should run and `-dir` in the directory with the website files. Remember to have an `index.html` in the website folder.
